# Grouping array elements

A function to make an array of things into an array of N arrays containing those things.

## Installation

This repo needs only TypeScript and Jest, installed with:

```
npm install
```

The default configurations are used for both dependencies. Nothing weird here!

## Tests

This repo uses Jest (via ts-jest) to run its tests:

```
npm test
```

## Notes

Full disclosure, I've done this test before. In fact at a previous job I reviewed many submissions for this test from prospective hires. This is my FizzBuzz!

My own previous submission for this test [lives here](https://github.com/ajrussellaudio/group-array-elements) and is built with JavaScript. I did not refer to my old solution while writing this new one in TypeScript, but I've arrived at a very similar solution this time, and my tests cover similar edge cases. I guess my brain still works the same way it did 4 years ago, which is nice.
